#The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory 
#database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states
#over the 10-year period 1999–2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

#1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
#Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
Q1 <- with(NEI, tapply(Emissions, year, mean, na.rm =T))
plot(c('1999','2002','2005','2008'), Q1)
#Yes, total emmisions have decreased

#2.Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999
#to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
Q2 <- subset(NEI, fips == "24510")
Q2.1 <- with(Q2, tapply(Emissions, year, mean, na.rm =T))
plot(c('1999','2002','2005','2008'), Q2.1)
#It has decreased from 1999 to 2008, with an increase from 2002 to 2005
