#Clustering organizes things that are close in groups

#Hierarchical clustering
#-aglomerate approach
#-Find closest two things

#-Requires
##-A defined sitance
##-merging approach

#-Produces
#-A tree showing hwo close thins are to each other

#Distance or similarity
##- Continuous - euclidean distance
##Continuopus - correlation similarity
## Binary - Manhattan diistance


#plot2 plots are composed of aesthetics (attributes such as size, shape, color) and geoms (points, lines, and bars), the geometric objects you see on the plot.
str(mpg)
qplot(displ,hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color=drv, geom = c("point", "smooth"))
qplot(y = hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)

#Box Plots
qplot(drv, hwy, data = mpg, geom ="boxplot")
qplot(drv, hwy, data = mpg, geom ="boxplot", color = manufacturer)

#histograms

qplot(hwy, data = mpg, fill = drv)

#The fourth is the argument facets which will be set equal to the expression . ~ drv which is ggplot2's shorthand for number of rows (to the left of the ~) and number of columns (to the right of the ~). Here the . indicates a single row and drv implies 3, since there are 3 distinct drive factors. Try this now.

qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, facets = .~ drv)

qplot( hwy, data = mpg, facets = drv ~ ., binwidth = 2)
