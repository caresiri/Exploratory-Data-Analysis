#Hierarchical clustering
#Swirl Course on hierarchical clustering
dist(dataFrame)
#Entry (i,j) indicates the distance between points i and j. Clearly you need only a lower triangular matrix since the distance between points i and j equals that between j and i.

#function which you can call which creates a dendrogram for you. It's called hclust() and takes as an argument the pairwise distance matrix which we looked at before.
hc <- hclust(distxy)
plot(hc)
plot(as.dendrogram(hc))
abline(h =0.4, col = "blue")
